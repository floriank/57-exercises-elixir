# 57 exercises for programmers - Elixir

This is the base repository for my take on the [book 57 exercises](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers) for programmers. This is done to keep record of all the exercises I've done to increase my fluency in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

This is the `ex/07-rectangular-room` branch. It deals with calculating the area of a rectangular room.

Constraints:

- Keep the calculations separate from the output.
- Use a constant to hold the conversion factor.
